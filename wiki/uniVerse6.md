# Our Universe

As we perceive it in our 6-dimensions perception space

I ([[@Michel]]) am viewing this universe from earth and therefore my perception of Verse6.0
is very limited, if on your side you have the capacity to comprehend the 6th dimension

This wiki page is for you to write about your 6D space.



Tell us more we are curious !

Gratitude
