### introduction
 Gyuri: (from hungary) hub interopabilty (IPLD)  MindGraph (knowledge federation)
  has a prototype kernel (end-2-end solution shipable w/i a 1 month)
 
 (same as solid project)
 
 decoupled storage for services

### 

* value chain and flow of information
  - if no value persives on project : no interrest from the communauty
  - allow flow information, need flow of "value" in equilibrium to make it sustainable

  - lower barriers and simplify process for publication of ones' knowledge
    - services are simply bought out and removed from the market-place
    -  monetization of knowledge --> remove the long-term attributes
    - people don't work w/ long-term-memory (this is a new mind-set)

 - time for case study, let's see emerging team, and see it viable.
   - process of emergence : convergence of collaborators
   - (need autonomous in energy and have common interrest)
   - (egocentric to alocentric model)
   - need to set the value-flow at the start ([[team-seeding|team seeding]]) !

 - memory agent, knowledge curator : need to be [[AI-assistant|AI assisted]] 1/1000s...
 - importance of [[curated-knowledge]] howeve today is very time/energy consuming, so it is not done today !
 - automation w/ integration with [[wikiData]] etc. [[youknows]].
 - because labor intensive, building memory is not systematic !
 - (work of agent need to be appreciated, or work need to automated and
    barrier to participation need to be lower)
  
 - problem of privacy (people don't want to give away their thoughts)
 - distributed web allow "secure" private knowledge capture
 - new tools adoption is harder than "re-inventing", (integration in own "holoSphere")
 - decentralized discovery (most seach engine are "index bases",
   (IPFS search is distributed).

 - memex (universal store and automatically index) ... /!\ using indexes is not discovery

* need single unified memory (system thinkers)
* corehency is important to build consistant
* universal graph model (IPLD)

### Existing infrasctructures 

* IPFS orbitDB
* StoreX (https://github.com/WorldBrain/storex )
* Scruflelbut

* PBworks
* tiddlyWiki
* P2P client for CI

* LikeinMind API (search API (access to PBWorks data))
* Gyuri's plateform ([[TrailMarks]] [[MindGraph]]) 

# long term collective memory plateform

* [TheBrain]()
* nomap (slow graphical interface)
* Digital life collective, [[DAOs]]
