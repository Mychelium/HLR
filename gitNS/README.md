## A simple idea that can get us far ...

every blockchain need to have some sort of mechanism to update the [[HEAD]] of the chain,
and this in a globally coherent way. 

In other word it need a "key-value-store" to learn about the latest mutable value !
this is the most complicated task to acheive in a trustless manner with out to be subject
to DDoS.

* Bitcoin chose the proof of work approach
* Etherium chose the proof of stake approach

And more amazingly none of the approach are trully decentralized. so why would we go
for the complexity of blockchain when some how we always keep a central point

in care of blockchain this central point is the knowledge or where to get the wallet
or the bootstrap ip-addresses, and hijacking of these central point totally void
the effort of securing the blockchain itselve.

our web today is totally centralized, we use DNS for accessing websites, even sensitive ones (like banks, goverments)
so why don't we use a centralized key-value-store for managing the mutables records of blockains'HEADs

The importance is the no-ownership of this central database rather than the fact it is centralized...
and therefore we can use GIT to acheive this.



## An alternative is to use permissionned blockchain where

* The consensus mechanism reply on a proof of "physical" identity
