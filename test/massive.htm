<h2> Massive Collaboration is now possible </h2>

... or <i>are we re-inventing hypertext link again ?</i>
<p>Indeed imagine all of our brains interconnected, imagine all what we know
shared globally at scale, imagine information flowing freely among us.

<p>
Well this is very close to a reality today ...
<p>You certainly know about [[wikipedia]], now it is totally decentralized
anyone can write a [[wikipage]] and post it anywhere...
and it will be automagically linked together into a worldwide knowledge tree.
everyone can discover and navigate.

<p>It sound amazing in, indeed it is we can turn any webpage into
a planetary wiki, all you need it write articles and pages
and instead of normal web-links place wiki-keyword into square brakets
like this : '[[myWikiLink]]'

and add one line of code to call a javascript resolver :
<br><code>&lt;script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mychelium/HLR@master/js/holoresolver.js>&lt;/script></code>

<p> we might even go further and write a browser extension that do it for
anysite visited w/o the need of altering the existing page...
<p> with the help of a little bit of AI we can tune the mapping algorythm
for more pertinance...

<p>The courant map is placed on #mychelium [blockchain][blockRing] at the following
address : <https://ipfs.blockringtm.ml/ipns/QmVuhSv2REdJwMAauvvnTsVbvb95kRXGFprp3gVQUj8z6d/wikimap.json>
and can be later on with the proper sharding be collaborativelly automatically update to reflect a global map of the worldwide wiki.
Rendering the system totally distributed, peer-to-peer.
<p>[[IPNS]] is the mutable naming services on top of [[IPLD]] / [[IPFS]] and require a long "resolution" time
for the discovery of the node who has the name record, hence leading to about 60sec delay time.
so the [wikilinks] will be resolve only after that delay; As a consequence the links in this page
won't be immediately evaluated, leaving you some time to see how they are written; alternatively
you can visit the "source view" of this page for more details on how it is done.

We can improve the speed the "name resolution" of IPNS by using an IPFS compatible [hash][MUT-224]
specially crafted for handling mutable in a faster way (i.e. where we don't need to collect 20 confirmations of the names
to decide what is the best uptodate value pointed by the key), or by using a more centralized approach like a DNS
or the hosted naming services [[gitNS]].
<p>
I keep a copy of the map in a central place for archiving purpose on [[GitHub]]
under the repository [mychelium/HLR](https://mychelium.github.io/HLR/wiki/wikimap.json).
<p>
Aggregation of shards of the wikimap can be done in serveral ways,
<ul>
<li> automatic merging of the blockrings maintaining the map,
<li> issuing pull requests on the GitHub repository containing the [[wikimap.json]]
<li> querying major search engine to see what [[WikiLinks]] are out there
<li> synchronizing with HoloRings' trusted friends
<li> placing a special [[%index-me]] tags in your map file
<li> sending me a note
</ul>

<p>I am currently working on the "create" page feature of the [wiki][federated wiki]
which is fundamental to boost participation !
<br>I am aware that keeping all the map pieces together at the world level
is a very set of data, not in the realm of a small startup, however with the help
of the big 5 clouds I believe it is totally feasible to bootstrap the system
until it become "sustainable" to self host the maps.

<p> Application of such a technology is limiteless...
the only hurdle is not technologique, indeed collaboration is possible only people agreeing 
on how they will exchange data, i.e. this boils down to a "name space" decision to handle
global ressources, as every individual wikilinks keywords can potentially collide with one another at the global level
so planning automatic deambiguation will be helpful, we can also prefix each link with its "origin"
to have conflicless maps.
</p>
<p>Now, Do you want accelerate this project ? send me a note, 
we always welcome an extra coding hand or ressources to move us forward.

<p>Anyhow I'd also would like to hear about your feedback on the idea,
will you use such a distributed wiki ?
